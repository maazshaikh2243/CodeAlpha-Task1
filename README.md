Hangman Game
Welcome to the Hangman Game! ðŸŽ®
This is a simple Python-based word-guessing game designed for students and beginners who want to have fun while practicing coding skills.

How the Game Works:
A random word is chosen from a predefined list of words.
You have 7 attempts to guess the word correctly by guessing one letter at a time.
If your guessed letter is correct, it will be revealed in the word.
If itâ€™s incorrect, you lose one attempt.
The game ends when:
You guess the word correctly and win. ðŸŽ‰
You run out of attempts and lose. ðŸ˜¢

Features:
Random Word Selection: The word to guess is chosen randomly from a list.
Real-Time Feedback: See your progress with each guess.
Input Validation: Ensures the user inputs only valid letters.
Fun and Simple: Perfect for anyone starting to learn Python!

How to Run the Game:
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Download or copy the hangman.py file to your computer.
Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the file is saved.
Run the following command:
python hangman.py

Skills Practiced:
Python basics (loops, conditionals, functions)
Random module usage
String and list manipulation
Input validation

Future Improvements (Optional for Students):
Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
Use a larger word list for more variety.
Implement a graphical interface or use ASCII art for the hangman.
